## Notes

- When communicating with developers, use the language they speak.
  - For example, if the developer speaks Japanese, respond in Japanese.
- Use Serena mpc server when referencing code or similar tasks.
- This project uses Nix and direnv to set up the development environment. By navigating to the target directory, you will automatically enter the environment created by `nix develop`.
